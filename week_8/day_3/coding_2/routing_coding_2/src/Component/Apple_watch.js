                   <p class="pt-3">The Proper Apple Watch Dock is a simple and elegant companion for your Apple Watch, designed with premium materials. Charge at your bedside or dock at your desk.</p>
                   <p class="pt-3">Simply take the charging cable that came with your Apple Watch and feed it through the Watch Dock â€” Once the charging cable is in place, plug it in and you're ready to charge!</p>
                   <p class="pt-3">We realised that we had a hook for our keys, a shelf for our wallet, and a stand for our phone, but nowhere to safely and securely rest and charge our Apple Watch. So we designed one.</p>
