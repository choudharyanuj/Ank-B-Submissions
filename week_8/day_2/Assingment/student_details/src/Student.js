Technically, an <br></br> individual’s learning style refers to the preferential <br></br> way in which the student absorbs, processes, comprehends <br></br> and retains information. For example, when learning how to <br></br> build a clock, some students understand the process by <br></br> following verbal instructions, while others have to physically <br></br> manipulate the clock themselves. <br></br> This notion of individualized learning styles has gained <br></br>  widespread recognition in education theory and classroom <br></br> management strategy. Individual learning styles depend <br></br> on cognitive, emotional and environmental factors, <br></br> as well as one’s prior experience. <br></br> In other words: everyone’s different. It is important for <br></br> educators to understand the differences in their students’ learning <br></br> styles, so that they can implement best practice strategies <br></br> into their daily activities, curriculum and assessments. <br></br> Many degree programs, specifically higher level ones <br></br> like a doctorate of education, integrate different <br></br> learning styles.</p>
